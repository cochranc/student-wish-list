# The Student Wish List Web Application 

## This web application allows student users to create wish lists of supplies they need for the school semester and alum users to view these anonymous lists and donate directly to students' needs. 

Notice: This is a prototype, so it is not affiliated with any institution and does not contain any real personal data or advanced security measures. 

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, clone this repo and install the needed dependencies:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

If it does not, feel free to create an issue request.
